# Component Development Project

This project focuses on the development of reusable components for web applications, adhering to accessibility standards and best practices. The components include a chart for data visualization, a table for displaying data, and a form for user input.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the components.
  - **components/**: Contains individual component files.
    - `Chart.tsx`: A component that renders a data visualization chart.
    - `Table.tsx`: A component that displays data in a tabular format.
    - `Form.tsx`: A component that handles user input and validation.
  - **styles/**: Contains CSS styles for the components.
    - `components.css`: Styles ensuring a consistent design and accessibility.
  - `App.tsx`: The main application component that integrates all components.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the application.

- **public/**: Contains the HTML template for the application.
  - `index.html`: The HTML file that serves as the template for the React application.

- **package.json**: Configuration file for npm, listing dependencies and scripts.

- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration file specifying compiler options.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd MDI_CODEEXAMPLE/component-development
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Design Decisions

- **Accessibility**: All components are designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that they are usable by individuals with disabilities.
- **Reusability**: Components are built to be reusable across different parts of the application, promoting a modular architecture.
- **Data Visualization**: The `Chart` component utilizes libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for effective data representation.
